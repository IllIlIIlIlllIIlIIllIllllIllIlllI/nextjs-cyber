## Why have this blog?

> I want to have a global and easily reacheable library of my projects and knowledge snippets

I founded this blog as a means to document the challenges and solutions. The main themes will be Software Engineering, Cyber Security and Data Science.

Writing is a known technique in cognitive psychology as a means to deepen understanding. This will also be a way of giving back to the community, for people who perhaps are encountering the same problems as I have.

This blog is a work in progress and is constantly being updated. However, I always appreciate constructive feedback on what can be improved!

## Tech stack

The blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

It takes inspiration from leohuynh.dev and karhdo.dev. I highly appreciate [Leo Huynh](https://x.com/hta218_),  [Timothy Lin](https://x.com/timlrxx) and [Do Trong Khanh](https://x.com/karhdo) for their contributions to this blog starter.


This blog has been changed to better suit my needs. I have taken a little bit of something from everywhere to make it attractive, while keeping it's performance in mind.

See the [source code](https://github.com/IllIlIIlIlllIIlIIllIllllIllIlllI/nextjs-cyber) for this blog.
